# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for students entering into a coding boot camp while doing the prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

- The goal was to get a basic understanding of the mentioned coding languages.
- I built this website for two reasons. First was to get experiance in using the tools that allow code to be utilized. Secondly was to have a place to see the notes that have and will be taken in one simplified location, while breaking them into related topics.
- As mentioned this website will allow notes to be accessed at a simplified and easy to read location.
- During the proccess of building i ran into a couple of issues including simple things like missing some very simple spaces and syntax locations, causing me to have to read and reread the code to find where I had caused the problem. To bigger issues (to me at the time) like missing steps in the git flow or pushing files that were not ready, or simply losing files completley and trying to retrieve them.
